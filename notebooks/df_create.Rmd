## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

friends <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-08/friends.csv')
friends_emotions <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-08/friends_emotions.csv')
friends_info <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-08/friends_info.csv')
```

### friends_emotions is missing some rows (full scenes, actually & everything in seasons 5-10)
```{r}
print(nrow(friends))
print("^friends -- we will NOT be using this dataset. Although it seems to have every line from all 10 seasons of the show, it fails to include any information on emotion or views")
nrow(friends_emotions)
print("^friends_emotions -- we WILL be using this dataset to determine how prevalent emotions were in each episode!
      1 issue: it doesn't have every scene & it doesn't have every episode! Only seasons 1-4. Scenes tbd")
nrow(friends_info)
print("^friends_info -- we WILL be using this dataset to determine when episodes aired and how many views each episode got")
```

## Creating Intermediate DataFrames

### DF1: emot_by_ep has the count of each emotion in each episode

```{r}
friends_emotions
```

```{r -- friend_emotion dataset, error = FALSE}
#Make DF emot_by_ep that has the count of each emotion in each episode

emot_by_ep <- friends_emotions %>%
  group_by(season, episode, emotion) %>%
  summarise(num_utterances = n()) %>%
  spread(emotion, num_utterances) 

## Replace any NA Values with 0s
emot_by_ep[is.na(emot_by_ep)] <- 0

## Create the tot_emot column that has the total # of emotional utterances in an episode
emot_by_ep <- emot_by_ep %>%
  mutate(tot_emot = Joyful + Mad + Neutral + Peaceful + Powerful + Sad + Scared)
  
emot_by_ep
```

```{r}
## Add new columns to emot_by_ep that track the % of each emotion (not just raw count)
emot_by_ep$Joyful_percent <- (emot_by_ep$Joyful/emot_by_ep$tot_emot) * 100
emot_by_ep$Mad_percent <- (emot_by_ep$Mad/emot_by_ep$tot_emot) * 100
emot_by_ep$Neutral_percent <- (emot_by_ep$Neutral/emot_by_ep$tot_emot) * 100
emot_by_ep$Peaceful_percent <- (emot_by_ep$Peaceful/emot_by_ep$tot_emot) * 100
emot_by_ep$Powerful_percent <- (emot_by_ep$Powerful/emot_by_ep$tot_emot) * 100
emot_by_ep$Sad_percent <- (emot_by_ep$Sad/emot_by_ep$tot_emot) * 100
emot_by_ep$Scared_percent <- (emot_by_ep$Scared/emot_by_ep$tot_emot) * 100
emot_by_ep
```


### DF2: friends_info has the 'metadata' on each episode like views, air_date, director etc.

```{r -- friends_info 2}
## add column that gives the raw episode index #
friends_info$episode_index <- 1:nrow(friends_info)
friends_info
```

```{r}
## Inspect 2 datasets that we'll merge together
emot_by_ep 
friends_info

print("emot_by_ep")
print(nrow(emot_by_ep))
print (colnames(emot_by_ep))
print("              ")
print("friends_info")
print(nrow(friends_info))
colnames(friends_info)
```


## Making the Final Datasets 
#### 1. episode_by_emotions -- includes the pure counts and %s of emotions in each episode + the metadata about each episode
#### Note: when we build the model, we'll likely need to be selective about which columns to use to avoid perfect colinearity!

```{r -- emot_by_ep & friends_info > episode_by_emotions}
episode_by_emotions <- merge(x = emot_by_ep, y = friends_info, by.x = c("season", "episode"), by.y = c("season", "episode")) %>%
  arrange(episode_index)

episode_by_emotions
  
```
```{r -- episode_by_emotions}
tail(episode_by_emotions)
```
